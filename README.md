Record and play mouse and keyboard events on windows

Start the app and hit record, position the mouse where you want to begin before the countdown ends.
Do something with mouse and keyboard then when you want to finish hit NumLock on the keyboard.
Hit close to finish or choose from the options to insert some logic into the script.

when you finish you can save your script to a file. it doesn't matter the file extention, i like to put - .sqn.
The saved file is just a text file you can edit.
